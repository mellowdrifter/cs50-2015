# cs50-2015
My code for all the regular and hacker psets for Harvard's CS50 course

# NOTE
If you're still doing the course, don't look at my code. You'll be doing
yourself a disservice by doing that. It's far better to understand the
material and do it for yourself.

This repo is more to keep track for myself and also compare code to those
who have already completed the course.

# NOTE 2
In addition to my actual pset code, you'll find various tests I ran in
individual .c files in various places. These were usually to test 
something in particular before using it in the main program
